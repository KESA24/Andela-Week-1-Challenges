                    <p>Technology and its benefits are far reaching and essential for all systems and sectors in the
                        world's economy to grow exponentially.
                        Technology introduces new ways of improvement, benefits felt in the increase of quantity
                        and quality of yields</p>

                    <p>The most basic and world's oldest sector I beleive. Agriculture is as old as humanity itself and
                        has stayed
                        the course with us since it addresses most of humanity's basic needs. Food and water are
                        addressed
                        through Agricultural systems.</p>

                    <p>Biosystems are how all living creatures interact with each other, from the smallest bacteria
                        or virus to the biggest organisms like the blue whales, elephants and
                        ofcourse us the humans as the God sanctioned custodians.</p>

                    <p> This is the 21st Century Industrial revolution. humanity started thinking with more than 2% of
                        their brains and gave birth to a computer. Given the initial computer was meant to help the army
                        in their calculations but it has grown 10000fold, we now use them to cook! </p>
                    <p>Examples of the earliest technologies include;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Steam trains</li>
                        <li>oil lamps</li>

                    <p>A hoe, this was the most basic technology invented for Agriculture. The ground had to be broken
                        to and the usual stones, sticks, bones were just not doing it and boom, the hoe.</p>
                    <P>From then, we went crazy, we have machines that can pick and sort fruits, the combine
                        harvestor is still growing and green houses are magnificient</p>

                    <p> Mother nature had her systems when humanity arrived but we have since evolved and left her
                        behind,
                        she doesn't need to anyway, she is perfect.
                        In our evolution we created our own therefore created imbalances in some of the systems. </p>
                    <p>To keep Mother nature's wrath at bay, we must find ways of obeying her rules or bending them
                        and using them to solve some of our problems. That's why we have biosystems tech that helps us
                        a condusive environment where all the organisms are happy and sometimes we only care about
                        humanity's happiness.</p>
                    <P>Examples of biosystems technology include;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biogas</li>
                            <li>Biometric systems among others</li>

                <article>
                    <P>Waste generation and reuse is an integral part of human activity. Solid waste can be
                        characterized by their source, original use, or physical and chemical composition.
                        Some types of solid wastes are managed by the waste generator, such as industrial wastes,
                        agricultural wastes, and mining wastes.
                        The wastes that are managed by municipalities are called Municipal Solid Waste (MSW).
                        The terrifying increase in the MSW is a vital indicator of natural resource depletion and
                        the exponential population growth.</P>
                    <P>Again, technology presents us with numerous ways to address our waste problems through
                        sorting waste effectively, to recycling machines, and waste management systems</P>
